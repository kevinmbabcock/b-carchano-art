Notes:
  * Needs(?)
    1. Button to purchase work. Rendered with each work in list.
  * Need to learn:
    1. How to add images through a form
    2. How to render WorkDeatils in modal

General Questions:

1. Should developer or admin be in charge of database?
2. How should admin tools be accessed?
3. Are empty <div>'s for formatting bad practice?
4. What other styling options are there? (instead of bootstrap)

For Brittany:

1. How many images for each work?
